# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The goal was to make a simple website with notes from the prework course.

- My motivation was to practice all the knowledge gained in a prework.
- I build this project, as that was necessary for understanding all the information from the prework.
- It puts all of the info in one place.
- I did learn how to use github, bash, vs code and how to debug my code.
